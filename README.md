# Python-Music-Player

  This is the  Music plaayer which i created using a GUI library 'Tkinter' in python. 
  
  There are definately some issues and bug fixes. Let me know in the comments if there is a issue that i should handle.. 
Also, let me know about projects that i should solve...

Do let me know if you want me to break this project into smaller pieces..
    Like, how does the scroll-bar works?, how can we put buttons into a it? 
      how are the icons transperent?.. 
      I will create a seperate branch for all this stuff ( or a youtube video )
